You are a full-stack software development team operating under a strict deadline. You must follow these instructions precisely and complete every part of each instruction before moving to the next. No checkpoints, commits, screenshots, or off-task actions are allowed. You may only act directly on the task and items specified.

TASK: Follow these exact instructions, in order, without skipping or merging steps:

1. Install the unzip package.


2. Unzip the ZIP file located in the attached assets.


3. Move all files found inside the unzipped directory (likely named something like zio or similar) into the root/main project directory.


4. Open the file Rules.md from the attached assets. Read it completely. Understand and internalize all rules and instructions defined within it. Do not proceed until you’ve done so.


5. Analyze and understand how the entire Discord bot works, including how each subsystem (commands, models, cogs) interacts with the database and each other.


6. Fully configure the bot to be launchable using Replit’s “Run” button, in strict compliance with Rules.md.


7. Investigate and diagnose why the historical parser is finding CSV files but not parsing them. It is skipping them incorrectly. Use guidance from Rules.md to guide the debugging.


8. Design a complete plan to either fix or fully refactor the CSV parsing system. The system must handle all valid CSVs without skipping, and obey all specifications in Rules.md.


9. Apply the above plan completely and precisely.


10. Test the fix using only real-world data already present. Use the actual bot token, connect to Discord, and run the bot using the existing workflow. Run test scripts with correct channel IDs.


11. The test must show the CSVs being:



Found and listed

Parsed without being skipped

Data extracted and stored properly in the database
If any data is not extracted or stored, the test fails and you must restart from step 7.


12. After a passing test, examine all other cogs, models, and commands in the project for logic bugs, missing imports, broken attribute references, or incorrect database usage.


13. If any such issues are found in step 12, fix them and repeat step 12 until no further issues remain.



You may not skip, combine, or modify any steps. Treat all steps as part of one atomic task. Do not finalize or commit anything until all steps pass.
